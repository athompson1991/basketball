    "We will focus on basketball, specifically the NBA. With basketball, we have more than one way to place bets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Money Line\n",
    "2. Point Spread (Over Under)\n",
    "3. Total Points (Over Under)\n",
    "\n",
    "The method I have focused on up to now is Money Line, but we may be just as interested in the other options as well. I will simply describe money line betting for now in the interest of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Money line betting\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this method is to bet purely on who will win. The odds will look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Houston Rockets**: -250\n",
    "\n",
    "**New York Knicks**: 210\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how to read this money line: a \\\\$250 bet on the Rockets will payout \\\\$350 if the Rockets win, and a \\\\$100 bet on the Knicks will payout \\\\$310 if the Knicks win. In other words, the Rockets are the *favorite* (the Knicks are the *underdog*) - you have to bet more on the Rockets than the Knicks for a similar payoff of around \\\\$330.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we can \"back out\" the implied probability of the winner/loser based on this information. In our given example, the implied probability is that the Rockets have about a 70\\% chance of winning the game. Basically, this is the formula and you solve for $p$ where $M$ is the money line for the favorite:\n",
