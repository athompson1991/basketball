# Basketball Scraping Project

This is the python project that is used to scrape the data for a research project in the CFRM program. The website www.basketball-reference.com is the primary
target of this scrape. In particular, the play-by-play data is desired (i.e. [this page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/201712020PHI.html), a random game between Detroit and Philadelphia).
